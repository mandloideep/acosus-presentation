## Notes

1. **Status Field**: Questions marked as **Inactive** are defined in the system but not currently presented to students. They may be activated for future cohorts or research purposes.

2. **Option Weightages**: Values range from 1-10, where higher values generally indicate more favorable responses for predicting student success.

3. **Priority Score**: Indicates the relative importance of each question in the overall assessment (scale 1-10).

4. **Data Types**:
   - `ordinal`: Responses have a meaningful order (e.g., "Excellent" > "Good" > "Average")
   - `cardinal`: Responses are categorical without inherent order (e.g., career aspirations)

5. **ML Feature Mapping**: The `questionID` (slug) serves as the feature name in the ML pipeline, combined with the `dataTypeForModel` to determine appropriate encoding strategies.
