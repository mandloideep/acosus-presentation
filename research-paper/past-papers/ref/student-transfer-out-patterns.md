## 2. Executive Summary & Conclusion

**Overview & Objective**
This study investigates the longitudinal behavior of students who transfer out of 4-year institutions. Unlike previous research, which often aggregates "transfer" with "dropout" or focuses solely on community college vertical transfers, this paper specifically isolates the "transfer-out" phenomenon at 4-year universities. The authors aim to identify how student characteristics (demographics, income), academic performance, and social integration influence the _timing_ and likelihood of transferring to another institution over a period of years.

**Methodology**
The researchers utilized data from the **2004–2009 Beginning Postsecondary Student (BPS: 04/09)** dataset, with a sample of 7,570 students initially enrolled in 4-year institutions. They employed **Event History Modeling** (specifically exponential modeling with period-specific effects) to analyze the timing of departures. This allowed them to observe how the effects of variables (like gender or GPA) change from year to year rather than treating them as static influences.

**Key Findings**

- **Social Integration:** This was a critical factor. Higher levels of social integration (participation in clubs, sports, arts) significantly reduced the likelihood of transferring. Notably, this effect became _stronger_ in later years (3rd and 4th year).

- **Demographics:** Females were generally less likely to transfer than males. Asian and Hispanic/Latino students were less likely to transfer compared to Caucasian students during the first two years.

- **Academic Performance:** Higher college GPAs reduced the likelihood of transfer in the first two years, challenging the notion that high-performing students frequently transfer to "trade up" to better schools. Conversely, lower admission test scores were associated with a higher risk of transfer.

- **Financial Factors:** Financial aid plays a retention role. Increases in Pell grants and student loans were associated with a reduced likelihood of transferring. Students from low-income families were significantly more likely to transfer, particularly in their third year.

- **Major/Discipline:** Students in specific majors (e.g., Life/Physical Sciences) were less likely to transfer in their first year compared to those with undeclared majors. Changing majors significantly increased the risk of transfer in the third year.

**Conclusion**
The study concludes that transfer behavior is complex and time-dependent. It highlights that "social integration" is a fluid construct that becomes increasingly important for retention as a student progresses through college. The authors suggest that institutions can actively reduce transfer rates by creating interventions that foster social engagement and support, rather than focusing solely on academic factors.

### Abstract

"While abundant studies on college student departure exist, few studies focus on student transfer-out behaviors. One may reasonably believe that transfer students leave their institutions at different times for different reasons. Coupled with the national dataset, this study longitudinally investigated transfer students who left their initial 4-year institutions. Results suggest that student characteristics, such as race and family income, had varying effects on the timing of transfer. Social integration was found to have significant effects on reducing the likelihood of transfer."

### Introduction

"Students transferring between postsecondary institutions are an integral piece of the higher education system in the United States." "Approximately 3.6 million students enrolled in postsecondary institutions in 2008 and 37.2% of these students attended a different institution at least once over a period 6 years."

"According to the Chronicle of Higher Education (Gonzalez 2012), among students enrolled in 4-year public institutions, about 50% of them transferred from their 4-year institutions to 2-year public institutions."

"However, Hossler et al. (2012) succinctly described the issues and consequences of this orientation to researching student transfer: Students who leave are often counted as lost to attrition. The consequence of this is that we lack the complete story of where students came from, and what happens when they leave."

### Conceptual Framework

**Tinto’s Student Integration Model**
"Tinto (1987) attributed a student's decision to remain at or depart from an institution to their social and academic environments within his or her institution." "Integration was separated into two, distinct types: academic and social."

**Academic Integration**
"Lundquist et al. (2002) defined academic integration as a student's general level of engagement in academic opportunities and activities, and they discovered that faculty support, accessibility to students, and quick responses to student questions were positively associated with students decisions to remain in school."

**Social Integration**
"Social integration, a student's relationship to their peers and faculty members, was another essential component of Tinto's model." "Tinto hypothesized that students who were socially integrated were more likely to develop a commitment to and to experience a sense of belonging at their institution." "Recently, Ishitani and Reid (2015) explored first-to-second year persistence at 4-year public and private institutions. They discovered social integration had a significant and positive effect on retaining students."

### Factors Affecting Persistence (Literature Review)

- **Race/Ethnicity:** "Students from racial and ethnic minority groups were at an increased risk for dropping out of college."

- **Parental Education:** "First-generation college students, defined as students who had neither parent graduate from college, were more likely to drop out during their freshman year... and, ultimately, were less likely to earn a college degree."

- **Academic Achievement:** "Student's precollege academic achievement on the ACT or SAT has been shown to have a measurable effect on student retention from their first year to their second year."

- **Finances:** "Most studies have identified an inverse relationship between tuition/fees and student persistence." "However, the effects have varied depending on institutional type or student demographics."

### Data and Methodology

**Study Data**
"This study used data drawn from the 2004–2009 Beginning Postsecondary Student (BPS: 04/09) dataset, which includes data collected longitudinally over a period of 6 years." "A group of students who matriculated at either public or private 4-year institutions as first-time, beginning students was obtained from the BPS: 04/09 for the current study." "This selection resulted in 7570 students who had intact information in the dataset."

**Dependent Variable**
"The dependent variable in this study was whether students transferred or not in each academic year." "Transfer was operationally defined as students who transferred from their initial 4-year institutions and never returned to their initial institutions during the survey observation period."

**Key Explanatory Variables**

- **Academic Integration:** Based on participation in study groups, social contact with faculty, meeting with academic advisors, or talking with faculty outside class.

- **Social Integration:** Based on participation in fine arts activities, intramural varsity sports, and school clubs.

- **Financial Aid:** Yearly amounts of Pell grants and loans (including PLUS loans).

**Analytical Method: Event History Modeling**
"Coupled with event history modeling, this study investigated the timing of transfer-out behavior at 4-year institutions over time." "Using Cox regression to analyze longitudinal retention data, an overall coefficient for each explanatory variable is estimated. In this study, we employed an exponential modeling with period-specific effects as our modeling technique to unpack coefficients unique to each academic year."

### Results

**Transfer Timing**
"Out of 1660 transfer students in the data, over 49% of them transferred to other institutions during their first year, followed by 26% by the end of the second year."

**Key Textual Findings**

- **Demographics:** "Females were found to be less likely than males to transfer in each academic year except for the third year." "Asian students were about 38 and 56% less likely to transfer in their first and second years, while Hispanic/Latino students were 43 and 40% less likely to do so."

- **Income:** "Students in the low-income quartile... were twice more likely to transfer in the third year, followed by 46% more likely to do so in the first year."

- **Test Scores:** "Negative effects of lower admission test scores extended over 3 years."

- **GPA:** "College GPAs were associated with reducing the likelihood of transfer in the first 2 years. Every one-point increase in the GPA was lowering the probability of transfer by 13 and 24% in the first and second years, respectively."

- **Social Integration:** "Effects of social integration were statistically significant through all the academic years." "Students were 45 and 36% less likely to transfer for every 50-point increase during the third and fourth years."

- **Financial Aid:** "Every $1,000 increase in Pell grant was associated with lowering the odds of transfer by 19% and 14% in the first and third years." "Loan amounts were also found to have positive effects on reducing transfer rates over 3 years."

- **Majors:** "Students who changed majors were approximately 64% more likely to transfer in the third year."

### Discussion

"This study revealed how different student and institutional characteristics were associated with student transfer behavior over time at the national level."

**Cost vs. Commitment**
"Upper-level courses are known to be more costly than lower-level courses... However, this may also suggest that students' institutional commitments are strengthened when students and their parents invest more money into their college education."

**Academic Misfit**
"Moreover, this study also suggests that students who experienced academic misfit were prone to student transfer. Students who changed majors were ultimately more likely to transfer, evidence parallel to the findings of Li (2010)."

**The Power of Social Integration**
"Social integration unveiled its positive and longitudinal effect on lessening the number of transfers. Furthermore, the effect of social integration increased in later years in their native institutions." "In fact, social integration's influence on student's decision not to transfer becomes stronger over time." "It is important that social integration be conceptualized as a fluid construct rather than a rigid and static idea."

**Summary**
"Given the significant effects of social integration, a lack of social support within the college environment partially triggers students to decide to transfer to other institutions throughout college years." "Furthermore, conventional wisdom may suggest that students with higher academic achievement are inclined to transfer to other institutions for more academic challenges. However, the findings in this study failed to support this notion, particularly students who had higher GPAs were less likely to transfer during the first 2 years in college."
