## 2. Executive Summary

**Context & Scope**
This study analyzes data from 25,565 transfer students at a large Midwestern flagship university ("MidU-Main") between 2012 and 2019 . It investigates "transfer shock" (a sudden drop in GPA upon transferring) and "rebound" (academic recovery in the second term). Unlike previous studies, this research explicitly compares three distinct transfer types:

1.  **Internal Transfers:** From regional campuses of the same system.

2.  **External Two-Year Transfers:** From community colleges.

3.  **External Four-Year Transfers:** From other universities.

**Key Findings**

- **Prevalence of Shock:** The average first-term GPA drop was -0.30 points.

- **Transfer Type Differences:** Surprisingly, **internal transfers** experienced the steepest GPA drop (-0.47 points) compared to external four-year (-0.23) and external two-year transfers (-0.21). Despite this, internal transfers had stronger persistence rates, likely due to "transfer student capital" and social networks .

- **The "Rebound" Effect:** Recovery is critical for retention. Students with steeper first-term drops were more likely to depart, but those who rebounded in the second term were significantly less likely to leave.

- _Specific Stat:_ Among low-GPA students with a steep initial drop, those who rebounded were less than half as likely to depart (36%) compared to those who did not rebound (73%).

- **Prediction:** While incoming GPA is a predictor of success, the magnitude of the initial shock and the ability to rebound are just as important in predicting student departure.

**Conclusion & Implications**
The authors conclude that transfer shock is a common phenomenon that institutions should normalize rather than penalize. They recommend:

- **Pre-appraisal:** Helping students anticipate a potential drop as temporary to protect self-efficacy.

- **Targeted Outreach:** Institutions should flag students arriving with a GPA below 2.0 or those who suffer a first-term drop greater than -0.50 for immediate academic support and coaching.

### Abstract

"As they navigate the social and academic expectations of a new college, transfer students commonly suffer 'transfer shock,' or a sudden drop in GPA. However, little is known about why some students suffer transfer shock, why some bounce back, and the consequences in terms of student retention. This analysis of over 25,000 transfer students () at a large flagship university finds an average first-term drop of -0.30 GPA points, but the impact of this shock on student departure is dependent on initial GPA, the steepness of the drop, and the student's ability to rebound in their second term."

"To support transfer student retention and graduation, sending institutions can help students to pre-appraise the potential setback as normal and temporary, while receiving institutions can provide proactive outreach to transfers who arrive with a GPA below 2.0 or who suffer a GPA drop steeper than -0.50 in their first term."

### Introduction & Literature Review

"Over half of college students attend two or more institutions on their way to a bachelor’s degree... As they navigate the social and academic expectations of a new college, transfer students commonly experience a sudden drop in their GPA, a phenomenon known as 'transfer shock'."

"Some students seem to 'bounce back' after transfer shock to regain their original level of academic success, while others do not... Although transfer shock is a well-established finding in the literature, little is known about why some students suffer transfer shock and others do not; why some bounce back while others do not; and the long-term consequences in terms of retention and graduation."

"Theoretical constructs related to resilience... would suggest that a sudden GPA drop will be perceived by some transfer students as a challenge that can be overcome, leading to increased motivation, persistence, and effort; but will be perceived by other students as evidence that they cannot succeed, leading to an erosion of motivation and persistence."

### Study Design & Methods

**Transfer Types**
"We classify students into three 'transfer type' groups: 'internal transfers' () who transitioned from one of the university’s open-enrollment regional campuses located in rural areas of the state; 'external two-year transfers' () who transferred from a community college or other two-year institution; and 'external four-year transfers' () who transferred from another four-year institution."

**Measuring Drop and Rebound**
"We calculate GPA change term 1 similarly to previous studies of transfer shock, by subtracting students’ incoming GPA from the first-term GPA alone. Positive values indicate a GPA increase; negative values indicate a GPA drop." "We calculate GPA change in term 2 in a similar way by subtracting students’ first-term cumulative GPA from their second-term GPA alone."

### Results: Extent of Drop

"Raw descriptive statistics... show that most transfer students (63%) experienced a decline in GPA during their first term at the flagship campus; students who experienced a drop had a decrease of -0.70 () GPA points, compared to an increase of 0.38 () GPA points for students who did not drop."

"However, the extent of drop varied by transfer type: Internal transfers had the largest drop, at -0.47 points... which was significantly steeper than the drop for external four-year transfers, who dropped -0.23 points... or the drop for external two-year transfers, who dropped -0.21 points."

### Results: Prediction of Departure

"The direction and size of coefficients suggest that... students with lower incoming GPAs, steeper first-term drops, or continued drops (or relative lack of rebound) in their second term were much more likely to depart the university."

"In terms of transfer type, internal transfers fared the worst in terms of their academic adjustment... however, they had significantly stronger persistence in the face of these challenges."

### Discussion & Practice Recommendations

"Our study suggests most transfer students will experience a GPA drop, even if they are familiar with the policies and standards of the university (as were the internal transfers in this study)."

**Recommendation 1: Normalization**
"First, institutions should work to reduce stigma or shame around GPA drop, and normalize it as a typical and temporary side effect of a transition to a new institution. Providing adequate time for students to pre-appraise a potential GPA drop as a normal speedbump may allow students to develop cognitive reappraisal strategies that help them stabilize their self-efficacy... in the event a GPA drop does occur."

**Recommendation 2: Proactive Outreach**
"Second, receiving institutions can pay special attention to incoming transfers who have GPAs below 2.5, in an attempt to head off a potentially disastrous GPA drop." "Third, at the end of their first term, receiving institutions can flag new transfer students who experienced a GPA drop greater than 0.5 during the term, and provide receive immediate outreach before those students embark on their second term."

**Importance of Rebound**
"Students who suffered steeper GPA drops in their first term were significantly more likely to depart, but those who 'bounced back' in their second term were significantly less likely to depart. For example, among low-GPA transfers with a steep initial drop, those who rebounded in their second term were less than half as likely to depart the university compared to those with no rebound (36% versus 73% departed)."
