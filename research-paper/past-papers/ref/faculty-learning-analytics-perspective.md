## Paper Summary

**Overview**
This paper, titled "Using Learning Analytics to Predict (and Improve) Student Success: A Faculty Perspective," addresses how individual faculty members can utilize Learning Analytics (LA) to enhance student retention and performance. While LA is often associated with large-scale institutional data mining, the authors argue that faculty can leverage data already available in Learning Management Systems (LMS) and their own records to make data-driven decisions.

**Key Findings & Discussions**

- **Definition:** Learning Analytics is defined as the measurement, collection, analysis, and reporting of data about learners to optimize learning environments.
- **Predictive Variables:** The paper highlights that simple data points—such as LMS login frequency, discussion board participation, and early assignment grades—are often strong predictors of final course success. For instance, discussion forum participation was found to be a significant predictor in several cited studies.
- **Tools:** It reviews tools used by institutions like Purdue (SIGNALS) and Rio Salado Community College (PACE) which often utilize dashboards to signal student risk levels.
- **Application:** Faculty are encouraged to use data descriptively (to understand what happened) and predictively (to intervene early).
- **Concerns:** The authors discuss ethical issues, including the risk of "profiling" students, data privacy (FERPA), and the "Big Brother" nature of tracking student activity.

**Conclusion**
The authors conclude that Learning Analytics is "here to stay" and offers a promising avenue for improving student success. They emphasize that faculty do not need to wait for institutional mandates; they already possess the necessary data to implement small-scale, high-impact interventions in their own classrooms.

## Verbatim Content Extraction

### Abstract

> Learning analytics is receiving increased attention, in part because it offers to assist educational institutions in increasing student retention, improving student success, and easing the burden of accountability. Although these large-scale issues are worthy of consideration, faculty might also be interested in how they can use learning analytics in their own courses to help their students succeed. In this paper, we define learning analytics, how it has been used in educational institutions, what learning analytics tools are available, and how faculty can make use of data in their courses to monitor and predict student performance. Finally, we discuss several issues and concerns with the use of learning analytics in higher education.

### Introduction and Definition

> Learning analytics is defined as "the measurement, collection, analysis, and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the environments in which it occurs" (Long & Siemens, 2011, p. 32).

> Learning analytics offers promise for predicting and improving student success and retention (e.g., Olmos & Corrin, 2012; Smith, Lange, & Huston, 2012) in part because it allows faculty, institutions, and students to make data-driven decisions about student success and retention.

> Data-driven decision making involves making use of data, such as the sort provided in Learning Management Systems (LMS), to inform educator's judgments (Jones, 2012; Long & Siemens, 2011; Picciano, 2012).

> Just as Amazon.com uses the data from our purchase history to make suggestions about future purchases, so can learning analytics allow us to suggest new learning opportunities or different courses of action to our students (Campbell, DeBlois, & Oblinger, 2007).

### Case Studies and Tools

> Many of the successful institutions have used or designed learning analytics tools that often provide a "dashboard" indicator to both students and faculty.

### Goals of Learning Analytics

> One motivating factor for the increased interest in learning analytics is the general trend for increased accountability in all levels of education.

> Learning analytics provides one of many methods to not only document student performance but also to provide tools that encourage the types of continuous improvement that accrediting bodies are seeking.

> Faculty have, for the most part, relied on their intuition and hunches to know when students are struggling... learning analytics promises to make these hunches and the resulting action more data-driven and easier to detect.

### Types of Data

> The goal of this paper is to highlight some data that faculty likely have at their fingertips that are amenable to some basic data analyses.

### Predictive Power of Data (Literature Review)

> The literature on learning analytics is replete with studies on the use of data such as these to predict student performance.

> Smith, Lange, and Huston (2012) used such LMS data as login frequency, site engagement, student pace in the course, and assignment grades to predict course outcome.

> Macfadyen and Dawson (2012) used LMS tool use frequency (e.g., number of discussion messages read, number of discussion replies posted) to predict student achievement (course grade).

> Falakmasir and Jafar (2010) examined student performance on activities that affected their final grade. They found that students' participation in a discussion forum was the best predictor of their final grades.

> Dietz-Uhler, Hurn, and Hurn (2012) found that performance on course assignments and tests at various times in the course significantly predicted final grades... Specifically, they found that performance on the first two exams, a quiz on the syllabus taken before the class started, and assignments in the second half of the course accounted for 98% of the variance in final course grades.

### How to Use Learning Analytics

> Learning analytics can be used to help students succeed and to improve retention. Learning analytics can provide insights into what is happening with the learner in nearly real-time.

> For example, if a student has not read a discussion board post for a certain period of time, this may suggest to an instructor that the student needs an intervention or a nudge.

> IBM (2001) suggests ways in which educational institutions can help improve student achievement. These include:
>
> - Monitoring individual student performance
> - Disaggregating student performance by selected characteristics such as major, year of study, ethnicity, etc.
> - Identifying outliers for early intervention
> - Predicting potential so that all students achieve optimally
> - Preventing attrition from a course or program
> - Identifying and developing effective instructional techniques

> May (2011) suggests that learning analytics can be both descriptive and predictive. From a descriptive perspective, learning analytics can help us answer such questions as: "What happened?", "Where was the problem?", and "What actions are needed?". Learning analytics can also help us to predict and prescribe by answering such questions as: "Why is this happening?", "What if these trends continue?", "What will happen next?", and "What is the best that can happen?".

### Benefits of Using Learning Analytics

> From the perspective of a faculty member... learning analytics can help faculty identify at-risk learners and provide interventions, transform pedagogical approaches, and help students gain insight into their own learning.

> If we can build a model of successful student behaviors, then we can encourage (with data!) our students to engage in these behaviors. Alternatively, we can also identify at-risk students as ones who deviate from this model.

### Concerns/Issues

> At the forefront of these issues is the role of pedagogy in data analytics. It seems clear that the pedagogy should drive learning analytics and not necessarily the converse (Greller & Drachsler, 2012).

> Campbell et al. (2007) provide a list of the issues and concerns...
>
> - **Big brother:** It may be threatening to some students and faculty to know that someone can "watch" and track all that they do.
> - **Holistic view:** There is a concern that any data set, no matter how comprehensive, cannot take in to account other issues, such as interpersonal ones.
> - **Faculty involvement:** Faculty need to be involved in order for learning analytics to have its greatest impact.
> - **Obligation to act:** Are faculty and institutions obligated to use data to increase the probability of student success?

> Other issues that are frequently highlighted in discussions of learning analytics include profiling and how learning-analytics data will be used. Specifically, there is a danger of creating a profile of successful and unsuccessful students.

> There are legal and ethical issues, such as FERPA, that need to be addressed before faculty or institutions can make use of some student data.

> Finally, there is the issue of whether or not we are really measuring student learning, or are we just attempting to boost student retention and course completion (Watters, 2012). If one considers the types of data that are mined for learning analytics, such as the number of course tools accessed in an LMS, or the number of posts "read" on the discussion forum, are these really proxies for learning?

### Conclusion

> It seems clear that learning analytics is gaining momentum and is likely here to stay (e.g., Horizon Report, 2012).

> In educational institutions, we have an enormous amount of data at our disposal. Our ability to harness this data and use it to inform what we do in the classroom, whether face-to-face or online, is at the heart of learning analytics.

> Individual faculty can make use of the data they have available in their courses to affect change and improve student success. These efforts, although seemingly "small-scale", can have a large impact on student success.
