## Executive Summary

**Purpose & Scope:**
This mixed-methods study investigates the factors influencing first-year community college students' decisions to transfer into baccalaureate STEM programs. It addresses a gap in literature regarding how STEM-aspiring students experience supports and barriers during this critical transition.

**Methodology:**
The researchers utilized an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design.

1. **Quantitative:** Artificial Neural Network (ANN) analysis was applied to survey data from 1,197 students to identify the most salient factors predicting transfer intent.
2. **Qualitative:** Follow-up interviews were conducted with 43 students to contextualize and explain the quantitative findings.

**Key Findings:**

- **Top Predictors:** The ANN analysis revealed that **initial attitudes toward science** was the strongest predictor of transfer intent, followed by GPA, attitudes toward math, transfer capital, and full-time employment status.

- **Student Experiences:**
- **Attitudes:** Successful students demonstrated a "curiosity to learn" and appreciated the "provability" of science. However, gender bias (e.g., science being a "guy's thing") posed significant barriers.

- **Grades:** Students often felt defined by their GPA; good grades acted as validation to persist, while fears of low grades acted as a deterrent.

- **Transfer Capital:** Access to clear information from advisors and peers increased transfer efficacy (confidence), whereas a lack of knowledge led to wasted credits and time.

- **Barriers:** Full-time employment created severe scheduling conflicts with STEM course availability. Financial constraints heavily influenced major choice, sometimes steering students away from longer educational paths.

**Conclusion:**
The study concludes that the "democratizing potential" of community colleges in STEM is complex. Success depends not just on academic metrics but on holistic supports—such as flexible scheduling for working students, assessing participation rather than just test scores, and actively cultivating positive science identities to overcome bias.

## Part 1: Literature Review & Methodology (Summarized)

### Background and Literature Review

While community colleges are recognized as major players in cultivating pathways to STEM careers , research on the specific supports and barriers for STEM-aspiring transfer students is sparse.

- **Existing Knowledge:** Prior research identified isolated factors such as math/science course success , socio-demographic backgrounds , and self-efficacy beliefs.

- **The Gap:** Most studies are cross-sectional (snapshots) or rely solely on one method (qualitative or quantitative). This study aims to use a longitudinal, mixed-methods approach to understand how these factors function together.

- **Conceptual Framework:** The study is guided by the **STEM Transfer Model** (Wang, 2016), which draws on social cognitive career theory (SCCT). It posits that transfer is affected by intersecting contextual factors (learning experiences, motivational beliefs) and person inputs (demographics, preparation).

### Research Design & Methodology

**Artificial Neural Network (ANN):**
Unlike traditional regression models that assume linear relationships, ANN is used to discover complex, non-linear relationships between independent and dependent variables without establishing presumed relationships in advance.

- **Input:** 32 independent variables (demographics, attitudes, preparation, etc.).

- **Output:** A binary indicator of the student's decision to transfer in STEM.

- **Result:** The model correctly predicted 78.61% of participants. Relative variable importance was calculated to determine the strongest predictors.

**Qualitative Interviews:**
Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 43 students to "give meaning" to the factors identified by the ANN. The researchers focused on the 10 most influential variables identified by the quantitative analysis.

### Quantitative Results: Relative Variable Importance

The ANN identified the following as the most important variables shaping students' decisions to transfer in STEM (in descending order of importance):

1. **Attitudes toward science** (Most influential)
2. **Academic achievement (GPA)**
3. **Attitudes toward math**
4. **Transfer capital**
5. **Employment: Full-time**
6. **Major declaration**
7. **Science preparation**
8. **Family income: Upper level**
9. **Family income: Middle level**
10. **Transfer efficacy**

### Qualitative Findings: Contextualizing the Factors

1. Initial Attitudes Toward Science

The most influential factor, initial attitudes toward science, underscored how students felt about their experiences with science content early on. Three themes emerged:

- **Curiosity to learn:** Having an innate curiosity and being actively engaged in the learning process appears to help students enter STEM courses.
- _Student Quote (Jim):_ "I'm like a compulsive tinkerer. I love taking things apart and trying to find out how things work."

- _Student Quote (Ben):_ "Biotechnology? It's like an emerging field... there's a lot of new stuff to learn in it and it seems really exciting."

- **Connections to students' lives:** The "provable" nature of science and its application to real life shaped positive attitudes.
- _Student Quote (Kelly):_ "I like also that it's more or less provable, you know like history is a lot of conjecture and there's no arguing with solid science."

- _Student Quote (Bethany):_ "...being able to grow it [insulin] in bacteria for, you know, diabetic patients like that was kind of like the very first thing I learned about that application and sparked my interest."

- **Surviving and thriving in STEM:** Students encountered biases (introversion stereotypes or gender bias) that could act as barriers or motivating factors.
- _Student Quote (Gwyneth):_ "I was thinking about going to school for chemistry, people telling me that they didn't think I could handle it, that it was too difficult, that it's more of a guy's thing."

- _Student Quote (Kirsten):_ "I think that the STEM is very underrated. STEM gets such a bad rep for being, I don't know. For having obviously not a lot of women."

2. GPA

- **Defined by grades:** Students perceived that grades would strictly determine their progress.
- _Student Quote (Mathias):_ "But if my grades don't reflect what they're looking for, chances are, I might not be able to get into that four-year college."

- **Validation to persist:** High grades served to affirm their pursuit of a STEM field.
- _Student Quote (Tom):_ "He [the instructor] said, 'I noticed that you did improve in your time in the class. You were asking questions... That's why he gave me a better grade.' That was nice."

- _Student Quote (J.J.):_ "I was able to maintain a 4.0 throughout the semester and that was really reassuring that got me ready for second semester..."

3. Initial Attitudes Toward Math

- **The perception that math takes work:** Students realized they had to work hard, but success was possible with effort.
- _Student Quote (Bill):_ "And after, I got a 50 on the first quiz. And after that, I decided I need to put more time into it... and it turned my grade around a lot now."

- **Developing an appreciation for math:** Even students who initially hated math found ways to appreciate it.
- _Student Quote (Kirsten):_ "I used to hate it, I couldn't stand math. But the more I've matured I realize math is really incredible and it's a great skill..."

- **Applying the abstract:** Seeing math applied in real life (e.g., electricity) or appreciating its definitive nature helped.
- _Student Quote (Scott):_ "where math, you can check that stuff... there's more a definite answer... So that's what I kind of like about it."

4. Transfer Capital

Transfer capital refers to the accumulation of tools and knowledge that help students navigate the transfer process.

- **Encouragement and support from advisors:**
- _Student Quote (Jim):_ "[My advisor] says, 'Well, you know, look into it and make sure you come back to me with enough time before you graduate so I can make sure that you get into something.' So, he was definitely on my side..."

- **The need to seek out resources:** Students often had to utilize websites or career expos to find requirements.
- _Student Quote (Elizabeth):_ "I'll go to the Centerville website and stuff and see for pre-med... and every so often check off, okay, I have this down, this down..."

- **Relying on others vs. Lack of Capital:** Relying on peers who had transferred was helpful, while a lack of conversation led to mistakes.
- _Student Quote (Clyde - Barrier):_ "now I'm not taking any transferring classes... That's the mistake that I made from the beginning. I didn't really know because I did not talk to my advisor about that."

5. Employment: Full-Time

- **Scheduling constraints:** Students found it challenging to reconcile school and work, often feeling "boxed in."
- _Student Quote (Jim):_ "I work a normal full-time job, so it's—I'm pretty much boxed into later afternoon or online classes... I just couldn't be there from eight to five..."

- _Student Quote (Gertrude):_ "...if you do school part-time you work full-time... and I can't afford to go part-time."

- _Student Quote (James):_ "Because I work every day, so it was kind of hard for me. I can't really do full-time school."

6. Major Decision

- **Overall cost of education:** High costs deterred students from certain paths (e.g., medical school) toward others (e.g., IT or automotive tech).
- _Student Quote (Kwesi):_ "I was going to go to law school, but I realized that the amount of money that I was spending... didn't add up so I chose... the IT field."

- _Student Quote (Hunter):_ "I guess first what I wanted to do was be an anesthesiologist... but I figured that might be a little bit more expensive... settled on this idea [automotive technician] because... you make a good amount of money afterwards..."

- **Job prospects:**
- _Student Quote (Rain):_ "It's all about the job... I don't think I've ever met a university student or college student whose goal was to just go learn."

- **Alignment with values:**
- _Student Quote (Stella):_ "I decided to switch to the biotechnology because I thought I could do more good... I would rather work on the research and development side of things than just watching people die."

7. Science Preparation

- **High school role:** Advanced placement or good experiences in high school supported entry, while poor foundations created barriers.
- _Student Quote (Hunter):_ "I took AP Biology when I was in high school... and I loved it. I decided to take two science classes the next year."

- _Student Quote (Elizabeth):_ "we didn't really get a good foundation in chemistry in high school because my teacher, she had maternity leave and after that it just went downhill."

8. Income Upper/Middle Level

- **Financial constraints:** Even with family support, money was a major stressor.
- _Student Quote (Kanda):_ "And pretty much now I'm out of money, so I have to borrow from my parents, and they want to retire so it's like they really want me to just finish my degree and get a job as soon as possible."

- _Student Quote (Kevin):_ "Dad says we're upper middle class, but I don't see it because most of our money is going everywhere else... And he said it was like 30% of our yearly income. Like really?"

9. Transfer Efficacy

- **Confidence vs. Anxiety:** Efficacy improved with knowledge, but sometimes knowledge of high requirements decreased efficacy.
- _Student Quote (Nico):_ "I pretty much knew what [I] was doing."

- _Student Quote (J.J.):_ "I was a little nervous when I heard you needed like basically a 4.0 to get in, I was like that's probably not going to happen once I start taking these high-level courses."

## Part 3: Discussion and Implications (Verbatim Content Focus)

### Cultivating Positive Attitudes Toward Science and Math

"Our findings underscore the significance of positive math and science attitudes to persist in STEM. Such attitudes or dispositions are linked with STEM achievement... Therefore, cultivating initial positive attitudes toward math and science may help students realize their path to becoming a scientist, even in the face of challenges or obstacles."

"Accordingly, the use of innovative teaching approaches or learning opportunities, such as active learning, contextualization, or research programs, among others, prove promising... Active learning can improve student performance in STEM versus more traditional lecture formats. Contextualization provides explicit connections between academic subject matter and application."

### Revisiting Academic Performance Measures

"Regardless of being an imperfect measure of academic performance, GPA can shape students' decisions whether to continue their STEM pathway. Our interview participants were acutely aware that they 'might not be able to get into that four-year college' if their grades were not high enough, internalizing grades as a key deciding factor on their path to transfer in STEM."

"Notwithstanding the value and importance of having a solid academic foundation, our findings suggest the inclusion of assessments that reward class participation and demonstration of knowledge in more informal ways... Teaching and learning in STEM is ripe for assessment modalities that allow students to demonstrate competencies in multiple ways, such as proposing and performing experiments, using math in applied ways, and designing and testing systems."

### Reconciling Work and School

"Students employed full-time found it challenging to pursue a STEM pathway when STEM courses were primarily offered during the day. These limited course options created a conflict with the students' work schedules." "Although working full-time may initially appear to be a barrier to students' paths in STEM, this can be minimized through intentional support and interaction at the classroom level. Furthermore, to address barriers to pursuing STEM due to employment and finances, community colleges should consider resources in the form of institutional or federally funded scholarships... aimed at students in STEM."

### Navigating the STEM Path: Cultivating Transfer Capital

"Transfer capital represents an intricate construct that can work toward or against students' paths in STEM. Although increased transfer capital might lead to higher transfer efficacy, more information does not necessarily help students feel more confident about transfer. This raises questions around how to cultivate transfer capital in a way that works toward higher transfer efficacy." "It is important that advisors help cultivate students' transfer efficacy via holistic and contextualized transfer capital, not merely presenting hard facts."

### STEM Perceptions and Mindsets: Overcoming Adversity

"Often times, STEM fields are seen as stressful, with competitive or exclusive learning environments that can discourage women and students of color who might otherwise pursue STEM." "Moreover, the 'scientific personality' or professional identity that individuals develop during their education and career can be disrupted, reinforcing the need for increased support for all students, especially those underrepresented in STEM." "In light of this finding, instructors, advisors, and other institutional staff need to frame the rigor of STEM fields as an intellectually stimulating part of the educational journey in these fields, while they tap into, cultivate, and celebrate students' agency and resilience."

## Conclusion

"Our mixed methods study illuminated significant factors shaping the road to becoming a scientist, as well as how those factors exerted their influences within the contexts of students' educational journeys... Transfer from community colleges into STEM programs at four-year institutions represents a crucial point of entry and access to STEM careers requiring a baccalaureate. However, the democratizing potential of community colleges in the STEM context is not straightforward. Our study brings forth a deeper understanding of community college students' STEM pathways, including the many plot twists and processes involved to overcome challenges and maintain progress."
