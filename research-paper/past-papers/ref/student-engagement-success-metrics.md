## Executive Summary

**Topic & Scope**
This paper investigates the academic success of **transfer students**, a growing but often overlooked population in higher education. The authors distinguish between **Learning Engagement** (behavioral effort) and **School Engagement** (interpersonal involvement/community) to understand how these factors influence "Term GPA" specifically for transfer students. The study also examines how "situational challenges" unique to transfer students (such as working off-campus >20 hours or part-time enrollment) negatively impact their success and whether engagement can mitigate these effects.

**Key Findings**

- **Study 1 (Learning Engagement):**
- **Behavioral engagement** (intentional, persistent effort) is a significant, positive predictor of Term GPA for transfer students.

- This relationship holds true across various demographics, including older students, women, and Hispanic/Latino students.
- Notably, the link between engagement and GPA was statistically significant for Hispanic/Latino students, suggesting engagement interventions may be particularly high-yield for this group at Hispanic-Serving Institutions.

- **Study 2 (School Engagement & Situational Challenges):**
- **Situational Challenges:** Working off-campus (>20 hours) and part-time enrollment significantly negatively predict GPA.

- **Mediation:** "School engagement" helps buffer these negative effects. Specifically:
- **High-Impact Practices (HIPs):** Participation in internships, research, or service learning partially mediated the negative effects of working off-campus and part-time enrollment.

- **Collaborative Learning & Student-Faculty Interaction:** These partially mediated the negative effects of part-time enrollment, particularly for women and Hispanic/Latino students.

- **Gender Differences:** School engagement predicted Term GPA significantly for women, but not for men.

**Conclusion & Implications**
The authors conclude that while institutions cannot easily fix a student's situational challenges (like the need to work), they can improve academic outcomes by fostering specific types of engagement.

- **For Faculty:** Incorporating collaborative learning and service-learning into the curriculum is essential, as transfer students often lack time for extra-curricular engagement.

- **For Institutions:** Creating mentoring programs and mandating High-Impact Practices can help transfer students—especially those from historically underserved groups—overcome the "time poverty" disadvantage.

### 1. Introduction

When students actively engage in learning, they are more likely to succeed. Student engagement has long been shown to have positive associations with student academic success. For transfer students, those who transfer from one post-secondary institution to another, student engagement may look entirely different than for more traditional undergraduate students. Transfer students are more likely to engage in higher education while also having multiple other roles or obligations competing for their time and attention, such as full-time employment or childcare obligations.

The present paper seeks to address gaps in transfer student research by examining critical elements of student engagement, namely learning engagement and school engagement, that may have implications for transfer students academic success as measured by semester grades.

#### Why Study Transfer Students?

In 2015, 49% of U.S. students who earned a bachelor's degree had enrolled in a community college at some point. While the majority of these students intend to transfer to a four-year institution, only about 26% make that transition, and of those, only about 57% complete a bachelor's degree within six years. The same low graduation rate is not seen with college juniors who have not transferred institutions; on average, 70% of non-transfer juniors obtain their bachelor's degree.

Transfer students are more likely to be older, come from low-income households, work more hours off campus, and care for dependents at home. Consequently, they are also more likely to spend fewer hours studying, and fewer hours involved and engaged on campus. Common stereotypical narratives suggest that transfer students lack the desire to be academically engaged or do not have the academic capital necessary to navigate the emotional demands of a four-year institution. However, these narratives detract from the lack of institutional investment in the social and motivational needs that these students may require to be successful.

#### Situational Challenges

Transfer students, as previously noted, are more likely to face some external challenges that present obstacles to their involvement that may not exist for non-transfer students. Working off campus is one such barrier to transfer student success. Working off campus more than 20 h per week has been shown to predict lower involvement and longer time to degree completion.

Compared to non-transfer students, transfer students are more likely to enroll part-time in college due to a number of situational reasons. Part-time enrollment has also been found to be indicative of lower student engagement in high-impact practices (such as research experience or internships), student-faculty interaction, and other on-campus activities.

### Student Engagement Framework

Drawing from Astin's (1999) Theory of Student Involvement, education practitioners are largely in agreement that student engagement is important for positive academic outcomes. Astin (1999) defines student engagement as, "the amount of physical and psychological energy that the student devotes to the academic experience". The Dual Component Framework of Student Engagement divides student engagement into active involvement in learning activities (also called learning engagement) and interpersonal involvement in the school community (also called school engagement).

#### Learning Engagement (Behavioral)

Learning engagement involves affective, behavioral, and cognitive involvement in learning activities. The current paper focuses on the behavioral engagement aspect, which is a part of learning that focuses on the direction of attentional effort that may be key for transfer students. The behavioral engagement component of learning engagement refers to effortful persistence. Behavioral engagement includes students willingness to put forth the effort necessary to achieve positive academic outcomes.

#### School Engagement

School engagement involves students interpersonal involvement in the school community. School engagement can involve the sub-contexts and activities within the school in which students participate academically, socially, or extracurricularly.

**Collaborative Learning:** One example of school engagement that is likely to lead to transfer student success is collaborative learning, or the structuring of the learning environment to facilitate interactions among student peers and between students and faculty to solve problems.

**Student-Faculty Interaction:** Academic-centered interactions between students and faculty have been shown to have positive impacts on undergraduate students' learning outcomes. For transfer students specifically, student-faculty interaction has been found to play a role in the level of student engagement in which they participate.

**High-Impact Practices:** High-impact practices are a compilation of institutional strategies and practices that have been touted in recent years as improving college student grades and retention. High-impact practices include practices such as undergraduate research, service learning, internships, and capstone experiences.

### 2. Study 1: Learning Engagement

**Research Question 1:** Does behavioral engagement predict term GPA for transfer students? We predicted that the effect of behavioral engagement on term GPA would be significant and positive.

**Results:**
Linear regression analysis was conducted to predict participants' term GPA by their level of behavioral engagement. Behavioral engagement explained 8% of the variance in term GPA. The model was significant with behavioral engagement positively related to term GPA for all transfer students in the study sample . Repeating the analysis among the subset of participants for whom transfer GPA was available, behavioral engagement remained a significant predictor when controlling for transfer GPA.

After Bonferroni adjustment, these analyses showed that the relations between behavioral engagement and term GPA remained significant and positive for older and younger transfer students, women and men, Hispanic/Latino, and white transfer students. Behavioral engagement explained the most variance in term GPA for Hispanic/Latino students (10%).

### 3. Study 2: School Engagement

Study 2 investigated situational challenges to better understand the mechanism through which school engagement (participation within sub-contexts within the school, including relational and psychological engagement) can contribute to the relation of these predictors to term GPA.

**Research Questions:**

- **RQ 2:** Do situational challenges, including working off campus and being enrolled part-time, predict lower school engagement among transfer students?

- **RQ 3:** Does school engagement significantly predict term GPA for transfer students?

- **RQ 4:** Does school engagement mediate the link between situational challenges, including working off campus or being enrolled part-time, and term GPA?

**Results:**

- **Predicting School Engagement:** Working over 20 h per week and being enrolled part-time were each significant negative predictors of student-faculty interaction. Transfer students in the sample who worked over 20 h per week were predicted to score 4.12 units lower on student-faculty interaction compared to students who worked 20 h or fewer. Working over 20 h per week and enrolling part-time each negatively predicted about 2% of the variance in number of high-impact practices completed.

- **Predicting Term GPA:** Collaborative learning significantly predicted term GPA for older students, women, and Hispanic/Latino transfer students. Student-faculty interaction was a positive but non-significant predictor of term GPA for transfer students overall, but the relation was significant for women and Hispanic/Latino transfer students. Participation in high-impact practices explained 4% of the variation in term GPA for the sample population.

**Mediation Models Findings:**

- **Collaborative Learning:** Partially mediated the negative relation between enrolling part-time and term GPA. This remained significant for both women and Hispanic/Latino students.

- **Student-Faculty Interaction:** Had a significant partial mediational effect between enrolling part-time and term GPA for women and Hispanic/Latino students. Additionally, it partially mediated the negative relation between working over 20 h per week off campus and term GPA for Hispanic/Latino students.

- **High-Impact Practices:** Significant partial mediator in the negative relation between working over 20 h per week off campus and term GPA, and enrolling part-time and term GPA.

### 4. General Discussion

Student engagement is important for transfer student success. Rather than assuming that transfer students know how to do college, institutions may benefit greatly from investing early in helping transfer students to develop strong behavioral engagement (persistent effort) and self-regulation techniques. These were shown in Study 1 to be significantly predictive of transfer student course grades.

Study 2 underscored some ways in which situational challenges faced by transfer students can impede school engagement for some students, with negative links to GPA. Transfer students enrolled part-time were less likely to report engaging in collaborative learning or high-impact practices, unlike non-transfer students enrolled part time.

#### Practical Implications

**Faculty Support:** Given the time constraints associated with working off campus over 20 h per week, faculty can help students to engage more meaningfully in high-impact and collaborative learning practices by incorporating them into their curriculum. For example, a service-learning component can help transfer students to participate in experiential learning while also earning course credit.

**Institutional Support:** One promising route for institutions to plan interventions for transfer students is to intentionally create strong mentoring programs. Transfer students enter four-year institutions mid-way through their undergraduate careers. This, presumably, leaves them with less time to develop faculty relationships before graduation.

### 5. Conclusion

While the way forward may not be clear cut, it is certain that four-year institutions must carefully consider the needs of transfer students, not only as they navigate the transfer process, but also after they have matriculated. Student engagement remains a strong predictor of student success for both transfer and non-transfer students. How higher education faculty and staff accommodate the ways in which students choose to engage, whether by choice or by circumstance, has to shift focus as they seek to serve the increasingly large and diverse proportion of undergraduate students in the United States.
