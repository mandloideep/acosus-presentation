## 2. Executive Summary

**Overview**
This study challenges the traditional method of evaluating state "articulation policies" (laws governing transfer between community colleges and universities). While previous research measured success by "transfer rates" (how many students move), Roksa and Keith argue that the actual legislative intent of these policies is **credit preservation**.

**Key Findings**

- **Legislative Intent:** A historical review of state statutes reveals the primary goal is preventing the loss of credits, not necessarily inducing new students to transfer.
- **Student Outcomes:** Using National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS) data, the study found that students in states with articulation policies **did not** have significantly better outcomes than those in states without them regarding:
- Bachelor's degree attainment rates.
- Time to degree completion.
- Total credits accumulated (efficiency).

- **The "California Effect":** California students skewed the data significantly; they tended to take longer and earn more excess credits, despite the state's robust articulation history.

**Conclusion**
Current articulation policies, as codified, do not appear to effectively reduce time-to-degree or credit loss. The authors suggest future policy evaluations must focus on credit efficiency rather than just headcount.

### Introduction and Problem Statement

> While state legislatures are increasingly enacting articulation policies, research to date provides little evidence that these policies enhance students' likelihood of transfer. Based on a careful historical review of state statutes, the authors propose that articulation policies do not improve transfer rates because that is not their intended purpose; the main goal of articulation policies is to prevent the loss of credits when students transfer within state higher education systems.

> Subsequently, the authors use the National Education Longitudinal Study to evaluate articulation policies based on an alternative set of outcomes: attainment of a bachelor's degree, time to degree, and credits required to complete a bachelor's degree.

### The Disconnect in Previous Literature

> Studies that have evaluated articulation policies to date present mixed results, and individual-level studies in particular suggest that articulation policies have no effect on students' likelihood of making the transition to four-year institutions.

> Instead of evaluating transfer policies with respect to transfer rates, as has been common practice in the literature, we advocate for an examination of a different set of outcomes that are more closely aligned with the stated intentions of state statutes: preservation of credits, time to degree, and bachelor's degree attainment.

> Following their stated intentions, articulation policies would be expected to reduce the number of credits lost in the transfer process, which would in turn reduce time to degree and potentially enhance bachelor's degree attainment.

### Analysis of State Statutes (Legislative Intent)

_The authors reviewed statutes from all 50 states to determine the actual language and intent of the laws._

> Our detailed review of state statutes led us to conclude that statewide articulation policies, as specified in the state legislation, are not designed to facilitate transfer per se. Instead, articulation policies are designed to preserve credits as students move from two-year to four-year institutions.

> These statutes indicate that articulation policies are developed to:
>
> - "promote a coordinated system of higher education and to assure an orderly and effective development of each of the publicly supported institutions of higher education" (Arkansas); _ "to maximize the transferability of course credits" (Connecticut); _ "for the purpose of facilitating and fostering the transfer of students without the loss of academic credit or standing from one public institution to another" (Massachusetts); \* "to ensure that students may transfer and apply toward the requirements for a bachelor's degree the maximum number of credits earned with as few requirements to repeat courses or to incur costs" (West Virginia).

> It is evident from these excerpts that the primary concern explicitly addressed by the legislature in adopting articulation policies is to preserve credits as students move between higher education institutions and thus promote a coordinated system of higher education, which prevents duplication, repetition of courses, and additional costs.

### Empirical Results: Outcomes After Transfer

_Using the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS), the authors compared outcomes in states with articulation policies versus those without._

#### 1. Bachelor's Degree Attainment

> Figure 1 reports that 61% of transfer students in states with articulation policies earned bachelor's degrees, compared to 57% of transfer students in states without such policies. This difference is neither large nor statistically significant.

> Logistic regression models controlling for student characteristics thus confirm descriptive results from Figure 1: Articulation polices do not appear to be related to bachelor's degree attainment.

#### 2. Time to Degree

> Figure 2 indicates that students in states with and without articulation policies took approximately 5½ years to complete their degrees. As might be expected, this difference is not statistically significant.

> Thus, the presence of articulation policies is not associated with the time students take to complete bachelor's degrees.

#### 3. Credits to Degree (Efficiency)

> Figure 3 reports that transfer students in states with articulation policies earn more credits in pursuit of their bachelor's degrees than students in states without articulation policies. However, this counterintuitive finding is again largely explained by California. In the California sample, students earn on average 157 credits on the journey to a bachelor's degree.

> As the final bar in Figure 3 indicates, if California is excluded from analyses, the difference between states with and without articulation policies declines substantially—only two credits—and is no longer statistically significant.

### Discussion and Conclusion

> The relevant outcomes for evaluating articulation policies thus are those that occur after students transfer to four-year institutions, particularly those related to the preservation of course credits.

> In our analyses, students who transferred to four-year institutions in states with articulation policies included in state statutes did not have better outcomes than those who transferred in states without such policies. Thus, the number of credits needed to earn a bachelor's degree, time to a bachelor's degree, and the probability of earning a bachelor's degree were not related to the presence of articulation policies in state legislation.

> However, we propose an alternative perspective: Future studies need to be designed to specifically evaluate the effectiveness of the stated purpose of the legislated articulation policies.

> Statewide articulation policies thus appear to standardize the transfer process, but at the same time they reduce flexibility, which may be particularly crucial for students who earn a large number of credits in community colleges.

> However, if state governments intend to prevent unnecessary duplication (which carries individual costs and public costs), it seems essential that they collect the data needed to evaluate whether current policies accomplish their goals. Articulation policies have the potential to serve both student and state interests. However, as of yet, that potential appears not to be realized.
