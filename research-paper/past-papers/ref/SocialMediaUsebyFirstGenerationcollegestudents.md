## Summary

**Overview & Purpose**
This qualitative study examines how First-Generation College Students (FGS) use social media (SM) compared to their Continuing-Generation Student (CGS) peers. Using **Social Capital Theory** as a framework, the authors investigate how SM usage impacts students' academic experiences and psychological well-being.

**Methodology**
The researchers used a **Revealed Causal Mapping (RCM)** approach to analyze narratives from 96 participants (73 FGS and 23 CGS) at an urban public university in the Western US. They mapped links between three types of SM use (social, cognitive, hedonic) and outcomes (academic support, emotional support, distraction).

**Key Findings**

1.  **Bridging Social Capital:** FGS rely significantly more on "bridging social capital" (loose connections/weak ties) for academic support than their peers. SM helps them find information and resources they cannot get from their families.

2.  **Bonding Social Capital:** FGS derive more academic and emotional support from "friend bonding" on SM compared to CGS, who often rely more on family bonding.

3.  **Gender Differences:**

- **Female FGS** are more likely to use SM for "cognitive" purposes (accessing content/articles) to gain academic support.

- **Male FGS** are more likely to use SM for "social" purposes to build bridging capital.

4.  **Distraction:** Both groups agreed that "hedonic use" (entertainment) generally serves as a distraction from academic work, though some viewed it as a necessary mental break.

**Conclusion**
The paper concludes that social networking technologies can empower FGS by helping them build social capital that they otherwise lack due to their background. The authors propose a model where SM acts as a critical pathway for FGS to access educational resources and emotional support, effectively helping to close the gap in college persistence and retention.

## Abstract

**Purpose:** The purpose of this study is to examine social media use and its impacts on first generation students by answering the two questions: how do FGS use social media on college campuses, compared to their peers? How does the use of social media affect their academic experiences?

**Findings:** The revealed causal mapping (RCM) analysis revealed nine key constructs that shaped the SM use and academic experience of FGS and their peers. The linkages among the nine constructs: three types of social capital (bridging, family bonding and friend bonding), three types of SM use (social, cognitive and hedonic) and three outcomes (academic support, emotional support and distraction to work) were different between FGS and their peers.

**Originality/value:** The research contributions are: (1) SM technology can empower FGS by building social capital, impacting their academic experiences and psychological well-being and (2) the intersection of gender and student generation status is worth investigation.

## 1. Introduction

First-generation students are students who enroll in post-secondary education and whose parents do not have any post-secondary education experience. Coming from a low-income household, first-generation college students were born with a financial disadvantage over which they did not have control, and such a financial disadvantage contributed to an opportunity gap and led to an awareness gap.

As social media become ubiquitous on college campuses, higher education institutions are considering how to leverage the social networking technologies to provide support and resources to the FGS population. Research on college students' use of social media (SM) has demonstrated that SM use may lead to the development of resources and networks, enhancing students' access to information resources and improving their self-esteem.

## 2. Theoretical Background

### 2.2 Social Capital and its Two Forms

In this study, we view social capital as comprising of both resources existing in a network and those made available through relationships built in the network. According to Putnam (2000), there are two types of social capital: bridging social capital and bonding social capital.

- **Bridging social capital:** refers to the loose connections between individuals who may provide useful information or new perspectives to one another.

- **Bonding social capital:** is found between individuals with emotionally close relationships such as family and close friends.

### 2.3 Social Media Use Categories

This study adopts the categorization of SM use by Ali-Hassan et al. (2015)—social, cognitive and hedonic.

- **Social use:** using SM to build new social relations (i.e. making new friends), identify individuals with shared interests and stay in touch with existing friends and acquaintances.

- **Cognitive use:** focuses on creating and sharing content and accessing content produced by other individuals, including sharing opinions, stories, ratings, debates, personal photos and videos.

- **Hedonic use:** refers to using SM for fun, passing time, relaxing and escaping.

## 3. Research Method

**Sample Characteristics:** In total, 96 responses were coded and analyzed for this paper. Among the 96 college students, 73 are FGS, accounting for 76%, while 23 are CGS (24%). Female students accounted for 58% and male 42%.

## 4. Findings

The data analysis revealed nine major constructs that are prominent in college students' engagement with SM and their academic experiences. The nine key constructs are: bridging social capital, family bonding social capital, friend bonding social capital, three types of social media use (social use, cognitive use and hedonic use), academic support, emotional support and distraction to academic work.

One type of SM use, i.e. social use, was found to be positively associated with both forms of social capital; it was also found negatively associated with bridging social capital. This set of social capital and the two types of SM use (cognitive and hedonic) were associated with three outcomes (academic support, emotional support and distraction to work).

### Data from Figure 1: Aggregated Revealed Causal Map (All Respondents, n=96)

_Note: Numbers reflect the percentage of that linkage over all identified linkages._

- **Social Use** SC Bridging: **0.14**

- **Social Use** SC Bridging (Negative): **-0.05**

- **Social Use** SC Bonding (Family): **0.07**

- **Social Use** SC Bonding (Friends): **0.10**

- **SC Bridging** Academic Support: **0.21**

- **SC Bridging** Emotional Support: **0.01**

- **SC Bonding (Family)** Academic Support: **0.06**

- **SC Bonding (Family)** Emotional Support: **0.01**

- **SC Bonding (Friends)** Academic Support: **0.07**

- **SC Bonding (Friends)** Emotional Support: **0.09**

- **Cognitive Use** Academic Support: **0.09**

- **Hedonic Use** Distraction to academic work: **0.18**

### 4.2 Comparing FGS vs. CGS (Data from Figure 2)

FGS emphasized the linkage between bridging social capital and academic support more than CGS did, as evidenced by 23% (FGS) vs 14% (CGS). Moreover, FGS also cited the consequence of friend bonding capital on academic support more frequently than CGS did: 8% (FGS) vs 4% (CGS). In contrast, CGS was more likely to utilize their family bonding capital for their academic support, as indicated by 16% of the linkages, as compared to 3% among FGS.

**Key Differences in Linkages (FGS vs CGS):**

- **Social Use SC Bonding (Family):** FGS (0.06) vs CGS (0.08)

- **SC Bridging Academic Support:** FGS (0.23) vs CGS (0.14)

- **SC Bonding (Family) Academic Support:** FGS (0.03) vs CGS (0.16)

- **SC Bonding (Friends) Academic Support:** FGS (0.08) vs CGS (0.04)

- **Hedonic Use Distraction:** FGS (0.18) vs CGS (0.18)

**Bridging Capital Importance:**
Compared to their peers, FGS were more likely to cite the linkage between bridging capital and academic support. As expressed by the respondents, these existing or new relationships would help the students to receive academic support and resources.

**Bonding Capital Importance:**
Compared to CGS, FGS were more likely to mention the benefits of bonding with friends on enriching their academic experience in college. As a FGS, the resources for academic support are limited from family members. However, our respondents expressed the valuable resources they received from their college friends through SM.

### 4.3 Further Analysis by Gender (Data from Figure 3)

The effect of social use on bonding capital and bridging capital differed by the gender identity of a FGS.

- **Social Use SC Bridging:** Male FGS (0.21) vs Female FGS (0.10)

- **Social Use SC Bonding (Family):** Female FGS (0.09) vs Male FGS (0.02)

- **Cognitive Use Academic Support:** Female FGS (0.10) vs Male FGS (0.05)

Female FGS were more likely to mention specific resources and tools online that are helpful to their course assignments such as term papers or course projects. It is common that the respondents cited YouTube videos as a learning aid when they do not understand topics for classes or Twitter as an outlet for current news and discussions.

## 5. Discussion

Our study has shown that the social media use by FGS and CGS contributed to both forms of social capital—bridging and bonding—which in turn positively impacted their academic work and emotional well-being.

**Key FGS Insights:**

- **Network-Informed Associating:** SM allow FGS to view the nodes and connections in the network, such as viewing who is being friends with whom so that one can send an invite to add that person as a potential new friend. This facilitates the bridging ties and bridging capital.

- **Bonding Shift:** Whereas it is unlikely for the FGS to receive academic resources from their high school-degree parents, they have developed new bonding social capital from their new college friends, who acted as knowledge sources to their coursework.

- **Distraction:** Overall, both FGS and CGS agreed that the hedonic use of SM was not helpful to academic work; it created a distraction instead.

## 6. Practical Implications

First, SM usage for educational purposes can be incorporated in the design and implementation of institutional high-impact practices because SM usage is conducive to social capital and strengthened academic performance of FGS.

Second, our study provides insights about how SM tools can serve the networking and help-seeking purposes of FGS effectively. As SM allow FGS to build new networks, from family and friends networks to academic and professional career networks, this networking capability afforded by SM has the capacity to improve FGS persistence.

## 7. Concluding Remarks

Our data analysis shows that SM use by FGS and their peers contributed to the two types of social capital—bridging and bonding which in turn were found supporting them academically and emotionally. This research's contributions are two-fold: (1) it provides educational institutions with useful guidelines to support and empower first-generation college students by using SM applications and (2) it provides evidence to show the impacts of SM use on psychological well-being through the development of bridging and bonding social capital.
