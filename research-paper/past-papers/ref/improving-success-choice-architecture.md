## 2. Executive Summary

**Context & Problem:**
The paper addresses the persistent achievement gap in U.S. higher education, specifically affecting minority, low-income, and first-generation students. The author argues that this "attainment gap" is significantly influenced by an "information gap" and "choice overload". Students are often overwhelmed by the complexity of course selection without adequate advice, leading to poor decisions that delay graduation or increase dropout rates.

**The Solution (Degree Compass):**
The author introduces **Degree Compass**, a course recommendation system developed at Austin Peay State University (APSU). Inspired by recommendation engines like Netflix, Degree Compass combines predictive analytics with "choice architecture".

- **How it works:** It uses past grade data and the student's current transcript to predict which courses the student is most likely to succeed in (getting an A or B).

- **The Constraint:** It _only_ recommends courses that apply directly to the student's degree program, ensuring efficient progression.

- **The Philosophy:** It does not use demographic data to make predictions to avoid stereotyping. It aims to "nudge" students toward success without removing their free choice.

**Key Findings:**
Implementation across APSU and three other Tennessee institutions yielded significant results:

1.  **Prediction Accuracy:** The system predicted passing grades with ~90% accuracy, and predicted grades were within ~0.6 of a letter grade of the actual outcome.

2.  **Grade Improvement:** Students who took recommended courses achieved higher grades compared to historical baselines.

3.  **Closing the Gap:** When looking at students who took a full schedule of _only_ recommended courses, the achievement gap between White and African American students was **cut in half**. Similar reductions were seen for low-income students.

4.  **Credit Accumulation:** There is a strong correlation between the number of recommended courses taken and the total credit hours successfully earned.

**Conclusion:**
The paper concludes that predictive analytics can effectively "move the needle" on degree completion. By providing a "technology-informed choice" rather than computerized decision-making, institutions can scale advising support. The data demonstrates that closing the information gap via personalized recommendations significantly reduces the educational achievement gap for at-risk populations.

## 3. Important Excerpts (Verbatim)

### The Problem: Achievement and Information Gaps

> "It has been a longstanding reality that success in higher education is very uneven across the population of the United States. Consistently over the last three decades racial minority, low-income, and first generation students have earned post-secondary degrees at substantially lower rates than their counterparts."

> "These attainment gaps appear to be significantly influenced by information gaps. First generation, low-income and minority students often do not have the advice system that surrounds students whose parents or other relatives have been to college."

> "Schwartz (2004) has argued for a paradox of choice that having too many options can lead to a decision paralysis... Often, poorer choices are made in situations of an abundance of choice... than in situations with more limited choice."

> "Given the multiplicity of choices entailed in selecting from a college's array of majors or programs... these adverse experiences may play a significant part in student success, especially for at-risk populations."

### The Solution: Degree Compass

> "We decided to create an interface in that vein, and developed a course recommendation system (Degree Compass) that successfully pairs current students with the courses that best fit their talents and program of study for upcoming semesters."

> "The model combines hundreds of thousands of past students' grades with each particular student's transcript to make individualized recommendations for each student."

> "Degree Compass was designed... to nudge students toward course selections in which the data suggest they would have the most productive success, but using an interface that would minimize choice overload."

> "In this way, the system most strongly recommends those courses which are necessary for a student to graduate, core to the institution's curriculum and their major, and in which the student is expected to succeed academically."

> "A five star class is one that, amongst the presently available courses, best fits the student's curricular constraints, and is one in which the student is predicted to earn as good a grade as they might earn in any other course... It does not necessarily mean that they will get an A grade. Indeed the interface does not reveal predicted grades to the student."

### Methodology & Ethics

> "Since one of the objectives was to try to impact the performance of subpopulations for which there has been an achievement gap in the past, we chose not to use any demographic information in the model."

> "We also chose to make the system faculty-agnostic by not disaggregating the grading patterns of different faculty."

### Key Results & Data

**Prediction Accuracy**

> "Data from Fall 2012 showed that the average predicted grades in the university settings were within 0.59 of a letter grade of the awarded grades, and 89 percent of those who were predicted to pass the course indeed passed."

**Impact on Grades and Graduation**

> "A comparison of student grades before the introduction of the system with those today shows a steadily increasing ABC%, with grade results across the institution today more than 5 standard deviations better than those in Fall 2010."

> "While it is still early to make general connections between Degree Compass and graduation rates, since the system was introduced at APSU in Spring 2011, the six-year graduation rate has increased from 33 percent to 37.4 percent, with the greater gains for low-income students (increased from 25 percent to 31 percent) and African American students (increased from 28.7 percent to 33.8 percent)."

**Figure 1 Data: Impact on Earned Hours**

> "For instance, those students who took a 12-hour schedule that contained no recommended classes earned only 2.5 credits on average, compared with 10.5 credits for those students whose entire schedule was crafted from recommended courses (see Figure 1)."

**Figure 2 Data: Closing the Achievement Gap**

> "For instance among students who attempted 12 hours, white students earned 10.06 hours on average, while their African American peers earned 8.06 hours on average. As we have seen, this is the familiar achievement picture nationally."

> "However, for those students who took 12 hours of courses all of which were recommended by Degree Compass, all students did better, regardless of ethnicity. White students earned 11 hours while African American students earned 10.3 hours on average. The 20 percent achievement gap was more than cut in half (see Figure 2)."

> "We see much the same picture for low-income students... low-income students earned 8.35 hours on average, while their peers earned 10.07 hours on average... However, for those students who took 12 hours of courses, all of which were recommended by Degree Compass, low-income students earned 10.3 hours while their peers earned 11.04 hours on average."

### Conclusion

> "The performance data above clearly demonstrate that students in both the university and community college settings progress more effectively through their degree programs when they follow a course sequence informed by data-analytics."

> "This is not computerized decision making, but technology-informed choice. The software provides additional information which the student and advisor are then able to use to make more informed decisions."

> "Since the data now clearly support that students taking the courses that they need is a crucial aspect of student success, it is incumbent on us to offer the classes that students need, when they need them."
