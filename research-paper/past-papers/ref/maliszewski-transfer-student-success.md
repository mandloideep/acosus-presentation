## Executive Summary

**Objective:**
This study investigates **Transfer Student Capital (TSC)**—defined as the knowledge community college students accumulate to negotiate the transfer process to a 4-year institution. While previous research identified _what_ TSC is (e.g., financial aid knowledge, transfer norms), this study explores **how** students acquire it and **how** they use it.

**Methodology:**

- **Design:** Descriptive qualitative case study.
- **Participants:** 17 transfer students at a large, public, research-extensive institution ("State University").
- **Data:** Interviews, observations of pre-transfer advising, and document review.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Sources of Capital:** Contrary to the assumption that college staff are the primary sources, **peers, family, and high schools** are the most influential sources of TSC.

- _High Schools:_ Provided early validation of the community college pathway.
- _Peers & Family:_ Provided critical "lessons learned" and shaped expectations.

2. **Function of TSC:** TSC is used not just for logistics (course selection), but to build **"self-efficacy for transfer"** (confidence).
3. **Role of Advisors:** Advisors and faculty are critical in building this self-efficacy, moving beyond simple information transfer to empowering students to advocate for themselves.

**Conclusion:**
The authors propose an expanded TSC model where capital is acquired throughout the educational pipeline (starting in high school) and is fundamentally social. Effective transfer support requires fostering self-efficacy and leveraging peer/family networks.

## Verbatim Excerpts: Key Concepts and Findings

_The following sections contain the text from the paper "as is" to provide full context for analysis._

### 1. Abstract

> **Objective:** This study seeks to expand understanding of transfer student capital (TSC), including sources of TSC and how TSC is used by community college transfer students to navigate transfer to a public, 4-year institution.
> **Results:** Family and peers appear to be the most common way that students gain TSC to navigate the transfer process. High schools also provide critical transfer information to students. Transfer advisors and faculty either at community colleges or 4-year colleges sometimes provide important transfer information but serve in a critical role of building students' self-efficacy for transfer rather than merely passing along transfer information.

### 2. Conceptual Framework: Defining Transfer Student Capital (TSC)

> Transfer student capital (TSC), or "how community college students accumulate knowledge to negotiate the transfer process" (Laanan et al., 2011, p. 177). The concept of TSC has provided a lens for understanding what sources of capital students utilize to navigate the transfer process.
>
> For the purposes of this article, we define TSC as the collective knowledge that students accumulate as they navigate the transfer process.

### 3. Findings: Sources of TSC

#### Peers and Family

> Peers, immediate and extended family members, and high school staff emerged as the top sources of TSC, as these individuals often provided information to students about the steps entailed in the transfer process and what to expect upon transferring.
>
> **Peers:** Sarah explained that she learned about the transfer process mainly through classmates. She explained: "Mostly it was my classmates and other ex-students I knew that went [to State University]. My cousin goes here. And a couple of my friends from high school go here. So they were kind of a big resource."
>
> **Family:** One of the most listed sources of TSC was family members, such as parents, aunts, uncles, and siblings. In many cases, family members provided TSC because they themselves had started at community college and transferred or because they had been a student at State University.
>
> Family members can provide students with key lessons learned so that they do not make the same mistakes in the transfer process.

#### High Schools (Unexpected Finding)

> One unexpected finding was that students acquired TSC while in high school, and approximately one third of the students in our sample referenced those high school sources as critical to their transfer planning.
>
> High schools provided not only critical TSC information that helped students navigate the transfer pathway, but also information that a community college was a viable pathway to a bachelor's degree.
>
> Alan indicated that even those outside of traditional sources of information at high schools provided some encouragement about the community college transfer pathway: "One of the secretaries that worked at my high school her son went to [community college] and transferred to the business school here. So, she talked me through I guess like made me think about the whole thing."

#### Community College Faculty

> Although not all students cited community college faculty as a key source of TSC, students did note that information provided by faculty was particularly influential.
>
> Many students echoed Castro's words by highlighting the role that community college faculty played in writing letters of recommendation for their college applications.

### 4. Findings: The Use of TSC

#### Navigating the Process

> Students spoke about TSC as information that helped them navigate the transfer process. Specifically, TSC helped students to better understand what courses would transfer to a 4-year institution, how the transfer application process works, and what to expect when transferring to a new college or university.

#### Building Self-Efficacy for Transfer

> One important way that TSC was used was to build students' self-efficacy for transfer. A theme that was evident in both the interviews and the observations is that advisors and community college faculty provided more than just information they provided encouragement and support to help build up students' self-efficacy for transfer.
>
> Sunnitha spoke about the support her advisor provided: "She was very encouraging... The most influential information was from my advisor again. She really helped in preparing me for success basically. She really encouraged me. 'You can do this; you're doing really well...'"
>
> College and university advisors and staff do more than relay key academic information; they also help provide a special source of TSC: self-efficacy for transfer.

#### Shaping Transfer Expectations

> Throughout the interviews, virtually all of the students highlighted the role that TSC played in shaping their expectations of the 4-year institution.
>
> Peers were particularly influential in shaping transfer students' expectations about transfer at a 4-year institution both before they transferred and after transfer occurred. Dwight shared: "I had several people tell me it's harder here. One coworker I had told me it was ten times harder... My cousin told me [State University] is like [community college] on steroids."

### 5. Discussion and Implications

#### Expanding the Model

> Our results showed that sources of capital—particularly peers, family, and high schools—can be very powerful in shaping students' transfer planning and the development of their expectations.
>
> This study further articulated an important function of TSC: building students' self-efficacy for transfer. As students collect information about transfer, they become more confident not only in their choices (such as selecting transferable courses), but also in building confidence that they can transfer.

#### Implications for Practice

> **High School Partnerships:** Therefore, it is essential that both community colleges and 4-year institutions work to foster relationships with high schools to provide information to students about their higher education choices.
>
> **Advising Training:** In institutions where faculty serve as academic advisors, colleges could implement a training specifically geared to fostering faculty members' abilities to provide support and encouragement to students to transfer.
>
> **Learning Communities:** Given that participants indicated peers are influential sources of TSC in the transfer process, universities and community colleges should further explore implementing learning communities that are focused on the transfer process and engaging peer networks.

#### Theoretical Contribution

> Our results indicate that TSC includes the expectations that students develop about transfer, the financial knowledge they acquire in community college, learning and study skills acquired in community college, motivation and self-efficacy for transfer, the knowledge students acquire about what transfer college is most appropriate for them, information about various transfer pathway options, and transfer course knowledge.
>
> Supported by the sources of TSC, we posit that students acquire TSC throughout the educational pipeline, beginning in high school and transitioning through the 2-year college and onto the 4-year college.
