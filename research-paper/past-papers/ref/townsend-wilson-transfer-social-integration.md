# Summary

**Overview**
This qualitative study investigates the long-term persistence of community college transfer students at a large, public, research-extensive university. The authors utilize **Tinto’s theory of student retention**—specifically the concepts of academic and social integration—to determine if the factors that influence the persistence of traditional first-year students also apply to transfer students. The study is a follow-up to a 2004 interview series, re-interviewing 12 persisting students to analyze their integration experiences near the completion of their degrees.

**Key Findings**

- **Academic Integration is Paramount:** Transfer students prioritized academic success (degree attainment) over the "collegiate experience." Factors facilitating this included small class sizes in their major, research opportunities with professors, and joining honor societies.
- **Redefining Social Integration:** Traditional social integration (e.g., dorm life, campus-wide events) was largely irrelevant to these students. Instead, they experienced "socially-oriented academic integration." Their social connections were forged through academic avenues, such as study groups and major-specific clubs.
- **Two "First Years":** Transfer students effectively experience two "freshman" years—one at the community college and one at the university—but their needs in the second instance differ significantly from native freshmen.
- **Barriers:** The primary barriers to integration were the large size of the university, lack of time due to off-campus work, and living off-campus.

**Conclusion**
The authors conclude that Tinto’s model regarding social integration (defined as extracurricular involvement) does not strictly apply to transfer students in the same way it does to native students. For transfer students, **academic and social needs blend together.** Consequently, institutions should focus on "socially-oriented academic integration"—promoting research with faculty and departmental clubs—rather than generic social programming, to support transfer student persistence.

## Abstract

This qualitative study sought to discern the applicability of Tinto's theory of the importance of academic and social integration to students' persistence by interviewing community college transfer students who had persisted for several semesters in a large, public, research extensive university. Twelve students who participated in a 2004 study about factors affecting the transfer process and their subsequent integration into the receiving institution were interviewed again in 2006 about their academic and social integration into the university. The researchers found that persisting community college transfer students' academic and social integration needs appeared to be different from those of first-year, traditional-age college students at a residence-oriented 4-year institution. The primary institutional influences affecting their integration were university size, the opportunity to join clubs in their major, and the opportunity to conduct research with a professor.

## Conceptual Framework

**Tinto's Theory**
Tinto's (1975, 1987, 1993) theory of student retention has greatly influenced college and university retention efforts in the past 3 decades. He posited that undergraduate students' persistence is influenced not only by their own characteristics, goals, and commitments but also by their experiences academically and socially within the institution.

- **Academic experiences** include interaction with staff and faculty both inside and outside the classroom as well as classroom learning experiences.

- **Social interactions** include both formal or institutionally provided co-curricular or "student-life activities" and informal interactions with peers in residential facilities or other institutional settings such as places to study.

Both these social and academic interactions contribute to a student's sense of belonging to the institution. According to Tinto, with sufficient academic and social integration into the institutional community, students will likely persist.

**Relevance to Transfer Students**
Because student attrition is greatest in the first year of college, it is understandable that Tinto's model has primarily been used to study the attrition of first-year students, whether at the community college or at 4-year institutions. However, his theory has rarely been used to examine the long-term persistence of students after they transfer from the community college to a 4-year institution.

According to Nora (2001-2002), the theory indicates that "a successful transition to college implies a sense of breaking away from the student's past community." If one accepts this premise, then community college transfer students would appear to have an initial "past community" from which they broke away in order to succeed at the community college, and a second "past community," the community college itself, from which they must transition to become successful in the 4-year college. As a consequence, community college transfer students could be seen as having two first-year college experiences: their first year at the community college and their first year at the 4-year college to which they transfer. Therefore, the constructs of academic and social integration may be important in both of these first-year experiences as well as in transfer students' long-term persistence.

## Methodology

This study was a descriptive exploratory one that built upon a previous study conducted in fall 2004. In 2004, the authors interviewed 19 community college transfers to a large, public, research extensive university. In the follow-up study, we wanted to see what had happened academically to the 19 students. That is, had they graduated, dropped out of school, or continued their enrollment at the university?

In spring 2006, we sent each of the 19 students in the initial study an individualized e-mail to her/his university e-mail account. We found that 18 of the 19 students in the original study were academic persisters. The 11 students still at the university met individually with one of the researchers for the interview, which was taped. In developing the interview protocol, we consciously used Tinto's constructs of academic and social integration to develop the questions.

## Results

### Student Profiles

Five of the 12 students were female and seven were male, 11 were white and one was African American, and two (both female) were nontraditional in age. The average number of hours transferred, according to student self-reports, was 54. Only two of the students lived on-campus their first semester, with the rest living off-campus alone or with roommates or with parents or spouse. None of the students mentioned choosing the university because of the collegiate experience it provided. As a "residence-oriented 4-year institution" ... the university has many Greek fraternities and sororities and Division I sports. Yet, none of these aspects of the university were mentioned as a reason for attending it.

### Academic Integration

**Transfer Shock and Initial Difficulty**
Most of the students in this study spoke of a drop in GPA, but it was usually minimal. Three of the 12 students reported academic difficulties their first semester and attributed them to a variety of reasons. When asked about feeling academically connected or integrated their first semester after transfer, all the students indicated they had not. Three attributed the lack of connection to not knowing anyone or knowing only a few people at their new institution, partly because it was so large.

**Factors Facilitating Integration**
As the semesters went by, all but one of the 12 students continued to do well academically. The other responses were primarily about what helped them feel they belonged academically.

- Four indicated belonging to the honor society or professional fraternity in their discipline made a difference.

- Three said being part of a small department was helpful because its classes were smaller and there were fewer faculty members to get to know.

- Another three said that working with faculty on research projects really helped. As one student said, "I was a part of something bigger than my courses" (Oregon).

### Social Integration

**Barriers to Connection**
When asked specifically about their social integration, particularly during their first semester, most indicated there had been difficulties. As one student commented, "It was pretty lonely for a while. I just knew my girlfriend and some of her friends and that was it" (Alaska). Four claimed that working kept them from having time "to do something extracurricular" (Idaho).

Part of not being a first-year student was not living on campus, a requirement for first-year students at this university. In fact, not living on campus emerged as the primary reason students felt they did not become more involved socially at the university.

**Integration via Major-Specific Groups**
Those who did make new social connections at the university usually did so through clubs or fraternities in their major. One person said it was only through joining such a club or "centralized group" that she was able to "meet people because there are so many people here and the campus is so spread out" (Arizona).

## Discussion

**The Primacy of the Degree**
Academic persistence and success, defined as achieving the baccalaureate, was what was of most interest to all the students. These students had a goal of achieving the degree, and this goal kept them persisting, in spite of sometimes feeling isolated socially, and largely having only work and studies in their lives.

**Socially-Oriented Academic Integration**
Social integration, as measured by participation in co-curricular activities, may not be an important factor in the persistence of most community college transfer students, partly because they come from an institution where the stereotypical forms of social integration... are not prevalent or particularly desired.

Approximately halfway through their baccalaureate program, these students were interested in activities that would help them achieve the degree: study groups, membership in a disciplinary club, and/or research with their professors. These academically oriented activities are perhaps sufficient vehicles for social integration. In other words, at least some community college transfer students' academic and social needs seem to blend together into a desire for **socially-oriented academic integration**.

**Implications for Practice**
From this perspective, both 2-year and 4-year college student affairs staff members, advisors, and faculty members need to work with prospective and current transfer students to inform them about clubs available in their major and possible opportunities for research with professors, after transfer. Additionally, 4-year college faculty and staff in academic departments need to become aware of the importance of research opportunities and disciplinary clubs to community college transfer students as a means for socially-oriented academic integration.
