## Executive Summary

**Overview & Purpose**
This study investigates the complexity of the transfer experience among students who began their postsecondary education at a 2-year college and transferred to a large 4-year university. The goal was to move beyond the "transfer shock" concept by examining the role and relevance of **"Transfer Student Capital" (TSC)** for student retention.

**Methodology**
Using the L-TSQ instrument, a 133-item online survey, the study collected data from over 900 students regarding their demographic characteristics, community college experiences, and university experiences. The researchers employed hierarchical multiple regression to analyze factors influencing academic and social adjustment.

**Key Findings**

- **Transfer Student Capital (TSC):** Learning and study skills acquired at the community college were a significant positive predictor of academic adjustment.

- **Negative Predictors:** "Stigma as a transfer student" was a significant negative predictor of academic adjustment. Academic counseling at the community college level also showed a negative correlation, suggesting potential issues with the accuracy or alignment of advice.

- **Social Adjustment:** Satisfaction with the university environment and faculty interactions were the strongest predictors of social adjustment.

### 1. Introduction and Problem Statement

For millions of students, especially women and ethnic minorities, the pathway to the baccalaureate degree can be achieved by starting at a community college and transferring to a 4-year college or university. Barriers to successful transfer can be attributed to lack of academic preparation, inaccurate transfer advising, unfamiliarity of academic expectations and rigor of the senior institution, and weak transfer and articulation policies.

The purpose of this study is to understand the complexity of the transfer experience among students who began their postsecondary education at a 2-year college and transferred to a large public 4-year university. Specifically, the goal of this study was to move beyond the "transfer shock" concept by examining the role and relevance of transfer student capital for student retention to postsecondary education within a hypothetical transfer adjustment model.

### 2. Definition of Key Concepts

**Transfer Student Capital (TSC):**
Defined by Laanan, the Transfer Student Capital (TSC) refers to the experiences of community college students who transfer to 4-year institutions. Specifically, TSC indicates how community college students accumulate knowledge in order to negotiate the transfer process, such as understanding credit-transfer agreements between colleges, grade requirements for admission into a desired major, and course prerequisites. Laanan further argues that the more TSC a student possesses, the greater likelihood of this student to successfully transfer from a community college to a 4-year institution.

**Transfer Shock:**
Early studies of transfer students have focused on the concept of "transfer shock" (Hill, 1965). That is, researchers sought to describe transfer students academic performance as measured by grade point average (GPA) and the extent to which the GPA drops after the first or second semester of attendance at the senior institution.

### 3. Theoretical Framework

This study takes a tri-fold theoretical framework which includes :

1. **Student Learning:** The model of student learning and cognitive development by Pascarella (1985), which suggests that students' learning and cognitive development are a function of direct and indirect effects of variables like background traits, institutional environment, and quality of student effort.
2. **Human Capital Theory:** The notion of human capital theory (Becker, 1993; Sweetland, 1996) was applied to measure the role and relevance of transfer student capital. The authors contextualized this notion... to examine the benefit of transfer student capital, where cumulative knowledge and experiences of higher education environment promote successful adjustment .

3. **Retention:** The notion of transfer as student retention in postsecondary education (Hagedorn et al., 2004, 2006, 2008), which affirms that students' academic success lead to a likelihood of transfer to a 4-year institution; thus, retaining them in postsecondary education.

### 4. Literature Review (Selected Highlights)

The studies of transfer students date back to the turn of the 20th century... Early studies of transfer students have focused on the concept of "transfer shock". Since then there have been a significant growth of policy reports and empirical studies that have investigated issues related to transfer and articulation policies, transfer student experiences, transfer process, and minority students and transfer.

A popular research focus has been to investigate the experiences of minority populations and the transfer process. Researchers have also examined the factors affecting transfer decisions as well as issue related to student involvement, institutional learning, and advising.

### 5. Methodology

**Data Source:** The target population for this cross-sectional study included more than 900 students who identified as transfer students from public 2-year colleges to Midwest University (MU) during 2004 and 2006.
**Instrumentation:** Data were collected using the Laanan-Transfer Students' Questionnaire (L-TSQ). The 133-item L-TSQ is a comprehensive instrument that collects demographic information about transfer students and their academic and social experiences at the 2 and 4-year environments.
**Analysis:** The study employed hierarchical multiple regression to examine the factors that affect successful transfer adjustment.

### 6. Results

**Descriptive Statistics:**

- Nearly 80% of the transfer students indicated that their educational aspiration at MU as obtaining a bachelor's degree.

- With regard to their first semester GPA at MU, more female transfer students had A (17%) than male transfer students (11.5%).

- It is noteworthy that more than 10% of both male and female transfer students had GPA of D, which might indicate their "transfer shock" during the first semester at MU.

**Predictive Model for Academic Transfer Adjustment:**
The adjusted R-squared value of .20 indicates that 20% of the variability in students' academic transfer adjustment is predicted by students' background, community college experiences, transfer capital, and experiences at MU.

- **Background:** Motivations for transfer was found statistically significant (beta = -.14).

- **Community College Experiences:** Experiences with general courses at a community college was found statistically significant (beta = .15).

- **Transfer Capital:** Academic counseling experiences (beta = -.09) and Learning and study skills acquired at a community college (beta = .26) were statistically significant.

- **University Experiences:** General perceptions of university (beta = .11), Course learning at MU (beta = .16), and Stigma as transfer student (beta = -.10) were significant predictors.

**Predictive Model for Social Transfer Adjustment:**
The adjusted R-squared value of .30 indicates that a third of the variability in students social transfer adjustment is predicted by the variables.

- **Community College Experiences:** Course learning at a community college was found statistically significant (beta = -.12).

- **Transfer Capital:** None of the independent variables from the transfer capital block were found statistically significant.

- **University Experiences:** Experiences with faculty at MU (beta = .11) and Satisfaction of the university environment (beta = .46) were statistically significant.

### 7. Discussion and Conclusions

**Academic Adjustment:**
One of the key findings was the positive influence of learning and study skills at a community college, which is as conceptualized as Transfer Student Capital, on the students' academic transfer adjustment. The examples of the learning and study skills that are found as significant include: "note taking skills," "problem solving skills," and "time management skills".

Another interesting finding was the significant influences of students positive course learning as well as being stigmatized as transfer students on their academic transfer adjustment. The finding revealed when students recognize their faculty and/or campus environment stigmatize them as transfer students negatively, such experience would impede students' academic transfer adjustment.

**Social Adjustment:**
It was interesting to find that course learning at a community college was not positively influencing students social transfer adjustment at MU. It might be that students developed their social skills regardless of their course learning experiences at a community college. Further, students' experiences with faculty at MU were found as a significant factor that could positively influence students social transfer adjustment.

### 8. Implications

- **For 2-Year Colleges:** Academic counselors need to be aware of the types of information and services prospective transfers need in order to make the successful transition to a 4-year university. Faculty can also play an important role. The extent to which the curriculum at the 2-year college is rigorous and requires students to do more reading, writing, and researching will improve student preparation for the 4-year institution.

- **For Universities:** To enhance transfer student capital, universities can offer new transfer students important information during orientation sessions about the strategies for a successful transition.

- **Counseling:** In working with students individually, counselors will be better informed about transfer students' issues and concerns and will be better prepared to assist students in their social, psychological, and academic adjustment process.

- **Stigma:** Future research that examines perceptions among faculty, staff, and students at MU toward community college transfer students might provide a better understanding of the influence of stigma on students' academic transfer adjustment.
