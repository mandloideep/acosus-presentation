## 2. Executive Summary

**Overview**
This study investigates the role of academic advising in the challenges faced by community college students transferring to 4-year institutions. The authors used a mixed-methods design to compare the satisfaction levels of "pre-transfer" students (community college students intending to transfer) versus "post-transfer" students (university students who had transferred from those community colleges).

**Key Findings**

- **Satisfaction Gap:** Pre-transfer students were significantly more satisfied with advising than post-transfer students on 11 out of 12 advising functions.

- **Relative Dissatisfaction:** Despite the difference between groups, both pre- and post-transfer students were significantly less satisfied with academic advising than they were with their overall educational experience.

- **Post-Transfer Challenges:** Qualitative analysis revealed that post-transfer students struggled with the complexity of university systems , felt disappointment regarding unmet expectations of "professional" university advising , and faced dire consequences for advising errors (such as wasted money and delayed graduation).

- **Pre-Transfer Advantages:** Community college students reported benefitting from multiple avenues for help and developing personal, friendship-like relationships with advisors.

- **Common Complaints:** Both groups cited inaccurate information, inaccessibility of advisors, and a lack of individuation (feeling like a number) as primary concerns.

**Conclusion & Implications**
The authors conclude that the "hand-holding" metaphor often applied to community colleges should be replaced with a "handoff" metaphor, emphasizing collaboration between institutions to ensure students do not drop the baton during transition. The paper proposes the implementation of **advising e-portfolios**. These portfolios would travel with the student, documenting goals, plans, and rationales, thereby improving information accuracy, continuity, and the student's ability to navigate complex university geographies.

## 3. Key Excerpts and Verbatim Content

### Theoretical Framework: Transfer Shock

> Transfer shock manifests as a well-documented temporary decline in grades for many students (Laanan, 2001) and involves feelings of alienation, isolation, and anonymity that transfer students experience when unfamiliar with the norms, values, and expectations of the university (Bennet & Okinada, 1990).

### Methodology

**Participants**

- **Pre-Transfer Students ():** Students at two community colleges who indicated their main reason for attending was to earn credit toward a bachelor's degree.

- **Post-Transfer Students ():** Students at five universities who had transferred from one of the two study community colleges.

**Instrument**
The study used the _Inventory of Academic Advising Functions-Student Version_, measuring satisfaction with 12 advising functions across five domains:

1.  **Integration:** Connecting academic, career, and life goals.

2.  **Referral:** Connecting students to academic and nonacademic resources.

3.  **Information:** Understanding policies ("How Things Work") and receiving "Accurate Information".

4.  **Individuation:** Knowing the student as an individual and considering skills/abilities.

5.  **Shared Responsibility:** Encouraging planning and decision-making skills.

### Quantitative Results

**Group Differences**

> Pre-transfer students rated their satisfaction with the advising they received higher than post-transfer students on 11 of the 12 advising functions; the exception was Accurate Information where no difference between the two groups was found.

**Advising vs. Overall Experience**

> Pre-transfer students were more satisfied with their overall educational experience () than with the academic advising they received (). Post-transfer students also were more satisfied with their overall educational experience () than with the academic advising they received ().

### Qualitative Results: Student Themes

#### A. Concerns Reported More Frequently by Post-Transfer Students

**1. Navigating More Complex Systems**

> Students accustomed to a smaller, more intimate campus found the physical geography and scale of the university system complex and challenging. They referred to the universities as bureaucratic, chaotic, and confusing institutions where information and direction were not easily obtained.

**2. Expecting Better Advising**

> They told us they had expected more from a university. To illustrate, one student said: "I... have been told by advisors that I do not need certain classes to graduate—then later on discover that in fact I do.... This is most certainly not the kind of conduct I would expect from a major university such as [this]."

**3. Dire Consequences for Advising Errors**

> Students expressed concern about wasted money and time, as well as delayed graduation and missed opportunities for graduate school and employment. _Student Quote:_ "This whole ordeal will require me to stay at [this university] for two more terms and completely postpones my initial plans for graduate school and a state job (which I have to turn down)."

#### B. Advantages Reported More Frequently by Pre-Transfer Students

**1. Multiple Avenues for Advising**

> Some pre-transfer students told us that when they were dissatisfied with advising at one campus (or center) of their community college, they would shop from campus to campus (or center to center) until they found advising that suited them.

**2. Significant Relationships**

> Pre-transfer students highlighted their significant relationships with advisors in far warmer terms than post-transfer students. _Student Quote:_ "She has been an amazing part of my journey and is not only my advisor but my friend and a remarkable place for support and encouragement!"

#### C. Concerns Common to Both Groups

**1. Inaccurate and Inconsistent Information**

> Advisors' inability to provide accurate information was the concern most often mentioned in the comments of both groups. _Student Quote:_ "My dead grandmother knows more about how this school works than my advisor."

**2. Inaccessibility**

> Students were dissatisfied with both the appointment and drop-in systems used to access advisors. _Student Quote:_ "I graduate this year and have never met with my advisor. I have tried, but can never get in. If an appointment is available, it is 3 months away. UNACCEPTABLE!"

**3. Lack of Individuation**

> Students mentioned over and over again that they felt like just a number or another name on a list. _Student Quote:_ "Instead, I'm left feeling like I just walked down the line in a cafeteria with other people behind me pushing me through, three cafeteria ladies on the other side slopping food on my plate. Before I know it, my tray is full, I've paid my money and I am headed for a seat—still wondering what the mound of goo is on my tray."

### Discussion: From "Hand-Holding" to "Handoff"

> Hand-holding is often used as a metaphor to explain the differences between the educational environments of community colleges and 4-year institutions. Alternatively, 4-year institutions need to provide community college transfer students "a hand hold for a little bit" (Townsend & Wilson, 2006, p. 450). Thus, we offer an alternative to the hand-holding metaphor, which is to consider the institutions' roles in the students' transition as a **handoff**.

> Like a relay race where both runners are responsible for the baton and hold onto it during the handoff to insure that it is not dropped in the transition, student success in the transition from community colleges to 4-year institutions results from collaborative efforts between the two types of institutions.

### Implication: The Advising E-Portfolio

The authors propose **e-portfolios** to facilitate this handoff:

- **Continuity:** "Advising eportfolios—collaboratively designed, supported, and accessed by advisors at both community colleges and 4-year institutions—can provide continuity and ease the transitional challenges."

- **Documentation:** "By documenting a student's goals and plans to achieve those goals, eportfolios provide the mechanism to assess the efficacy of these plans... and avoid the dire consequences of advising errors."

- **Rationale Tracking:** "By asking students to articulate in the eportfolio their rationale for educational choices, advisors can detect educational plans or actions that are based upon inaccurate or incomplete information early."
