## 1. Data Analysis Methodology

### 1.1 Quantitative Analysis

#### 1.1.1 Descriptive Statistics

**Survey Completion Metrics:**
- Completion rate: (completed responses / total starts) × 100
- Average time to complete survey
- Dropout points identification (which questions cause abandonment)

**Demographic Distribution:**
- Frequency tables for categorical variables (role, experience level, team size)
- Central tendency measures for continuous variables

#### 1.1.2 System Usability Scale (SUS) Analysis

The SUS provides a standardized measure of perceived usability on a 0-100 scale.

**SUS Calculation Method:**
1. For odd-numbered items (1, 3, 5, 7, 9): score = response - 1
2. For even-numbered items (2, 4, 6, 8, 10): score = 5 - response
3. Sum all adjusted scores and multiply by 2.5
4. Final score range: 0-100

**SUS Interpretation Benchmarks:**
| Score Range | Grade | Adjective Rating |
|-------------|-------|------------------|
| 90-100 | A+ | Best Imaginable |
| 80-89 | A | Excellent |
| 70-79 | B | Good |
| 60-69 | C | OK |
| 50-59 | D | Poor |
| < 50 | F | Awful |

**Target Threshold:** SUS ≥ 68 (industry average for acceptable usability)

#### 1.1.3 Likert Scale Aggregation

**Processing Approach:**
- 5-point scale: Strongly Disagree (1) to Strongly Agree (5)
- Calculate mean and standard deviation for each item
- Report median for ordinal interpretation
- Visualize with diverging stacked bar charts

**Composite Score Construction:**
- Group related items by construct (e.g., trust, usefulness, ease of use)
- Calculate Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency (target: α ≥ 0.70)
- Create composite scores by averaging item responses

#### 1.1.4 Statistical Tests (If Sample Size Permits)

| Analysis | Test | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| Group comparisons | Mann-Whitney U / Kruskal-Wallis | Compare scores across experience levels |
| Correlation | Spearman's rho | Relationship between trust and perceived accuracy |
| Pre/post comparison | Wilcoxon signed-rank | If repeated measures collected |

*Note: Non-parametric tests preferred due to expected small sample size and ordinal data.*

### 1.2 Qualitative Analysis

#### 1.2.1 Open-Ended Response Coding

**Coding Process:**
1. **Initial read-through:** Familiarization with all responses
2. **Open coding:** Generate initial codes from data
3. **Axial coding:** Group codes into categories
4. **Selective coding:** Identify overarching themes

**Coding Framework (Initial Categories):**

| Category | Description | Example Codes |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Usability | Interface and interaction feedback | navigation, clarity, layout |
| Trust | Confidence in predictions | accuracy, reliability, skepticism |
| Usefulness | Practical value perception | time-saving, actionable, relevant |
| Concerns | Worries or hesitations | privacy, over-reliance, bias |
| Suggestions | Feature requests and improvements | visualization, integration, customization |

#### 1.2.2 Theme Identification

**Thematic Analysis Steps (Braun & Clarke, 2006):**
1. Generate initial codes from participant responses
2. Search for themes among codes
3. Review themes against coded data
4. Define and name themes
5. Report findings with supporting quotes

**Expected Theme Areas:**
- Prediction accuracy perception
- Trust calibration factors
- Workflow integration preferences
- Feature enhancement requests
- Ethical/privacy considerations

#### 1.2.3 User Pain Points and Suggestions

**Documentation Template:**

| Pain Point | Frequency | Severity | Suggested Solutions |
|------------|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| [To be identified] | n (%) | High/Med/Low | [From participants] |

**Prioritization Matrix:**
- High frequency + High severity = Critical (address immediately)
- High frequency + Low severity = Important (plan for next iteration)
- Low frequency + High severity = Monitor (investigate edge cases)
- Low frequency + Low severity = Minor (document for future)
